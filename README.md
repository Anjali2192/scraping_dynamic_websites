# Selenium Dynamic Scraping Practice

This repository documents my learning journey of scraping dynamic websites using **Selenium in Python**.  
Each script focuses on a specific concept such as login, pagination, and ethical scraping practices.

# ðŸš€ What's Next in My Selenium Learning Journey

As I continue building my web scraping skills with Selenium, here are the next steps I plan to work on:

## ðŸ”œ Upcoming Topics to Practice

- **CAPTCHA Awareness**
  - Learn how to detect CAPTCHAs (only for awareness; never bypass illegally)
  - Understand limitations and ethical boundaries

---

## ðŸ’¡ Personal Goals

- Stay consistent with small, focused scripts
- Push every meaningful update to GitHub
- Document what I learn in README and comments
- Build confidence to take on freelance scraping gigs
